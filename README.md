## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is the computational task of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It helps in summarizing vast textual data by identifying emotions or polarities (positive/negative).

### Objectives:
- Understand peopleâ€™s preferences for cuisine, location, and dining type.
- Predict restaurant ratings based on review comments using an LSTM model.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source:** Zomato Bangalore Dataset
- **Number of Entries:** 51,717
- **Key Columns:**
  - `reviews_list`: User reviews
  - `rate`: Ratings (target variable)
  - `cuisines`: Restaurant cuisines
  - `location`: Restaurant locations

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Remove redundant columns and duplicates.
2. Handle missing values.
3. Normalize the `rate` column by removing `/5`.
4. Clean `reviews_list` using:
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing punctuations, stopwords, and URLs

## Model

The sentiment analysis model is built using an **LSTM** architecture and pre-trained FastText word embeddings.

### Architecture:
1. **Input Layer:** Tokenized review sequences
2. **Embedding Layer:** Pre-trained 300-dimensional FastText embeddings
3. **Spatial Dropout:** Prevent overfitting
4. **Bi-directional LSTM:** Extract contextual features
5. **Global Pooling Layers:** Max and average pooling
6. **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers for classification
7. **Output Layer:** Softmax activation for 9 possible rating classes
